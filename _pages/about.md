I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (DECSAI) at the University of Granada, located in Spain. I am currently working with Fernando Berzal and Juan-Carlos Cubero on data mining over network data. I am interested in all the branches of data mining, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence, specially in machine learning usign deep learning techniques.

In 2017, I worked four months as visiting researcher at the Data Science Institute (DSI) at the Imperial College London, where I learned and developed tools for large-scale data visualization.

In 2014, I performed an internship at Real-Time Innovations (RTI), from March to September, where I worked in the development of a new template-based system for
the RTI code generator (rtiddsgen).

I started my scientific career with a research fellowship, from July 2011 to May 2012, under the supervision of Armando Blanco. During this period of time, I exhaustively studied and developed candidate genes prioritization methodologies. Later, from November 2012 to September 2013, I was hired as a full-time researcher, in the same team, to study drug repositioning methodologies and develop new methodologies.

In 2007, I studied a 5-year university degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Granada, in Spain. Later, in 2013, I pursued a master’s degree in Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems, a 1-year university master’s degree in deep learning, probabilistic reasoning, evolutionary algorithms, and fuzzy logic.
